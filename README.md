# ironhack-css-specifity-exercise

For purely educational purposes, I have complicated the proposed exercise a bit by trying to refactor the CSS as proposed. 

I have approached "refactoring" in the strict sense, so I needed to add some unit tests before starting to modify the code. 

I have chosen Backstopjs as framework to perform visual regression tests.

To install run: 
npm install -g backstopjs

To run the test:
backstop test

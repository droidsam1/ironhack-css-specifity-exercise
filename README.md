# ironhack-css-specifity-exercise

Just for educational purposes, I just try to refactor the CSS as propose. Meaning 'refactoring' in strict sense, so I needed to add some unit testing before start modifying the code.
I picked Backstopjs as a framework to perform visual regression testing

To install execute:
npm install -g backstopjs

To run the test:
backstop test
